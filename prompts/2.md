Optimized Claude Code Prompt — Onboarding Enhancement

Enhance the onboarding experience for a first-time player who:

Has never played this type of game before

Arrived via a social media redirect (low context, low attention)

The onboarding must assume zero prior knowledge and quickly make the game feel intuitive and fun.

Onboarding Goals

Explain the game by letting the user play, not by text-heavy instructions

Minimize cognitive load

Create an “aha” moment within the first minute

Make the user confident enough to host or join a real game immediately after

Core Requirements
1. Interactive Tutorial (Mandatory)

Onboarding must be hands-on, not passive.

The user should play through a mini story as a guided example.

Treat onboarding as a scripted demo game, not a slideshow.

Flow example (illustrative):

Show a short public plot.

Prompt the user to ask a yes/no question (multiple-choice at first).

Simulate the Game Master’s answer.

Give hints or nudges if the user is stuck.

Gradually remove guidance.

Reveal the solution and explain why the questions worked.

Hints should:

Be contextual

Appear only when needed

Teach how to think, not just what to tap

2. Role Clarification Through Play

During the tutorial, implicitly teach:

What the Game Master does

What the Players do

Avoid long role explanations upfront.

Use short callouts like:

“You are acting as a player here”

“In a real game, another human would answer this”

3. Visual-First Onboarding

Use as many images and visual elements as possible.

Reduce raw text to short, scannable lines.

Recommended visual assets:

Illustrated story cards

Simple diagrams showing:

GM vs Players

Question → Answer loop

Icons for:

Yes / No / Irrelevant

Hint

Reveal solution

Optional light animations or transitions to reinforce understanding

Assume images are local static assets bundled with the app.

4. Pacing & Skip Logic

Onboarding must be:

Fully skippable at any time

Resume-aware (if user leaves mid-onboarding)

If skipped:

User lands directly on the story selection screen

If completed:

End with a clear CTA (e.g. “Start a real game”)

Technical & Architectural Constraints

Implement using React Native + Expo + TypeScript

Follow the domain-oriented architecture

Onboarding logic lives under:

src/domain/onboarding/


Reusable UI elements must come from:

src/ui/


Animations, gestures, or tutorial helpers belong in:

src/technical/

What to Produce

Onboarding user flow (step-by-step)

Screens and states involved

Components required (including visual assets placeholders)

How hints and progression are managed

Example pseudo-code or TS snippets where useful

Assumptions made about images or animations (document briefly)

Prefer clarity and concrete decisions over flexibility.
